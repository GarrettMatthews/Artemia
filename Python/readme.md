This program, while unelegant, creates csv files of each plate, counting the number of deaths over the length of the trial. See csv files for examples of how data should be formatted. Simply, however, it is Day of the Month, Month, Year, Plate Name, Day of the Trial, Well Name, Alive, and Molted. Alive an molted are boolean values 1 (true) and 0 (false).
